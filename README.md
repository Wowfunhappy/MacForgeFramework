# mySIMBLFramework

mySIMBLFramework is a framework for installing/updating/removing a modern version of SIMBL that works on macOS 10.9 and above. This project uses a modified version of SIMBL to load plugins into applications and is designed as a successor to the original SIMBL which no longer works properly due to changes made by Apple. Using this framework it's easy to integrate some basic controlls for managing mySIMBL in your application.
