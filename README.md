# SIMBLFramework

SIMBLFramework is a framework for installing/updating/removing a modern version of SIMBL that works on macOS 10.9+

SIMBLFramework uses a modified version of SIMBL to load plugins into applications. This project was designed as a successor to the original SIMBL which no longer works properly on macOS 10.9 and above due to changes made by Apple. This project makes it easy to integrate some basic controlls for managing SIMBL into an application.

# Features

- install/update/remove SIMBL.osax and SIMBLAgent
- check if SIMBL needs updating
- check system integrity protection status
- [planned] patch/unpatch Xcode 8+ to allow plugins to load
- [planned] enable or diable system integrity protection on 10.11.0 - 10.11.4
