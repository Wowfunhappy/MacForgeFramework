# Modern SIMBL.osax with 32bit support

I'm using SIMBL on Mavericks, and I want my plugins to work inside of 32bit apps.

This is a lazy edit of w0lfschild's MacForgeFramework which lets me compile a 32bit-compatible version of SIMBL.osax. The files for all targets other than SIMBL have been deleted.
